title: Scraping a dataset of images from Facebook
---

Working on a project with Python and Selenium to scrape a bunch of images from Facebook. I'd never written a scraper or talked to a headless browser before, and found the process pretty fun. I'm sure this isn't the best way of extracting a list of Facebook images and their metadata, but it works! (For now.)
