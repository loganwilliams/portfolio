This seems like an incredible quantity of food. Is this really what two people eat? I guess on a normal day I don't exert as much physical effort as our calorie plan is anticipating.

Basically, just dehydrated chili. Substituted tofu for ground beef, not sure if that was necessary to make it shelf-stable. Needed more kimchi.
