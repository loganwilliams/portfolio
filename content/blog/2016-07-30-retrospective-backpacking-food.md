title: Hindsight -- packing for a six day backpacking trip
---

This seems like an incredible quantity of food. Is this really what two people eat? I guess on a normal day I don't exert as much physical effort as our calorie plan is anticipating.

## Dinner

Clockwise from top left

### Tuna alfredo

* Basil garlic linguine
* [Alfredo sauce powder](http://www.food.com/recipe/alfredo-sauce-mix-381157) *(substitute dry ingredients)*
* Tuna fish (*the [REI smoked salmon](https://www.rei.com/product/761630/seabear-smoked-salmon-35-oz) is awesome in this, if it's in stock*)

*Take 3/4 of a package of the Trader Joe's linguine, and roughly half the quantity of alfredo sauce powder.*

### Chili

Basically, just dehydrated chili. Substituted tofu for ground beef, not sure if that was necessary to make it shelf-stable. Needed more kimchi.

* Dehydrated chili
* Cheddar cheese (not pictured)

*[This recipe](http://www.trail.recipes/recipes/trail-chili/) produced a good quantity when roughly tripled or so. Enough to eat when you make it and enough for the two of us later.*

### Za'atar mashed potatoes and beans

* Potato flakes
* Egg powder
* Milk powder
* Dehydrated onions
* Dehydrated black beans
* Dehydrated spinach
* Boullioun cube
* Olive oil
* Salt, pepper, and za'atar

*Two bags of mashed potatoes was too much. Onions added a nice crunch. Two cups of black beans was a bit much but pretty close.*

### Egg burritos and beans

* Mountain House breakfast skillet
* Dehydrated spinach
* Dehydrated black beans
* Tortillas (not pictured)

*This was a good amount of food.*

### Ramen peanut noodles

* Ramen *(2 packs)*
* Peanut butter
* Soy sauce
* Seasoned rice wine vinegar
* Sesame oil
* Green onions
* Peanuts
* Broccoli (not pictured)
* Bell pepper (not pictured)

*This was a good amount of food.*
