title: SimpleHTTPServer and you
---

Apparently, the problem I was trying to solve last Thursday, loading local resources while serving a site from localhost, is pretty common. [Rachel](http://rfol.io/) clued me into Python's SimpleHTTPServer, which, basically, does what it says on the tin.

With Python serving up the images, I now was able to get up and running on building a website that pulls images from the database and displays them. A few hours later, and I had this:

![Timeline app, as of tuesday]({{site.baseurl}}/images/timeline_monday.jpg)

Pretty basic, but it's working. Now, I need to figure out how to paginate my database subscriptions and get some fancy CSS transitions in there.

Picked up some cherry tomato starts from someone on Nextdoor. Apparently they can grow six feet tall! We'll see how this goes.
