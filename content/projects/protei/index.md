<p>Protei was an open source sailboat developed with a diverse team of artists and engineers at the <a href="http://v2.nl">V2_ Institute for the Unstable Media</a>. After a month-long collaborative rapid prototypign and design process, this Protei prototype was developed with a unique flexible hull and a novel actuator design, with the intent of tugging a long, oil absorbent tail through small oil spills. I was also personally responsible for developing system firmware, motor control, and sensor feedback. More details of our design process and the final sailboat can be found in our <a href="images/protei/Protei-Handbook-web.pdf">handbook</a>.</p>
