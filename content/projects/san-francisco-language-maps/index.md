San Francisco is one of the most multilingual places that I have ever lived. I was curious about who spoke what, and where, so I made some maps in the style of The Racial Dot Map to try to show this data. I also wanted to avoid the rendering issues that The Racial Dot Map has, where certain classes of dots are always drawn on top of other classes of dots - in these maps, the rendering order of each dot is randomized.

Click on each map for a full-size version.

These maps were created using Matplotlib Basemap with data from the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey. They may be used under a CC BY-NC-SA license. Note: the U.S. Census groups multiple languages spoken in and nearby China under the common name "Chinese." As a result, I was unable to differentiate Mandarin, Cantonese, Hokkien, etc.
