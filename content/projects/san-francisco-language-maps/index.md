San Francisco is one of the most multilingual places that I have ever lived. I was curious about who spoke what, and where, so I made some maps in the style of [The Racial Dot Map](http://demographics.coopercenter.org/DotMap/) to try to show this data. I also wanted to avoid the rendering issues that The Racial Dot Map has, where certain classes of dots are always drawn on top of other classes of dots - in these maps, the rendering order of each dot is randomized.

Click on each map for a full-size version.

These maps were created using [Matplotlib Basemap](https://matplotlib.org/basemap/) with data from the U.S. Census Bureau's [American Community Survey](http://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/). They may be used under a [CC BY-NC-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/) license. *Note: the U.S. Census groups multiple languages spoken in and nearby China under the common name "Chinese." As a result, I was unable to differentiate Mandarin, Cantonese, Hokkien, etc.*
