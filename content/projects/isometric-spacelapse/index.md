<p>By transposing the axes of time and image-space position, unusual aerial viewpoints can be generated. In these videos, all rays intersect the horizontal plane at the same angle and all objects are rendered at the same scale.</p>

<p>With this isometric view, everything is granted equal importance and nothing can be diminished to the background. Hills stand next to buildings, and the foreground, so often human, is forced to reckon with with the scale of its setting.</p>
